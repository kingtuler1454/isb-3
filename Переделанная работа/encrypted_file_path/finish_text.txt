the need to encrypt and transmit encrypted messages arose a very long time ago. So, even in the ancient Greeks used a special encryption device. according to the description of the plutarch, it consisted of two sticks of the same length and thickness. one was kept for oneself, and the other was given to the departing. these sticks were called wanderers. when the rulers needed to tell some important secret, they cut out a long and narrow strip of papyrus, like a belt, wound it around their wanderer, leaving no gap on it, so that the entire surface of the stick was covered by this strip. then, leaving the papyrus on the wanderer as it is, they wrote everything they needed on it, and after writing, they removed the strip and sent it to the addressee without a stick. since the letters on it are scattered in disorder, he could read what was written only by taking his wanderer and winding this strip around it without gaps
